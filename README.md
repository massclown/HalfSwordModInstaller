# Half Sword Mod Installer

# How to use it

## Simple mode
When the game is not running, start the installer, and press the big button.

## Advanced mode
Open the advanced mode by selecting the corresponding tab.

The table on the screen shows all the mods that are known by the installer, and their status.

UE4SS is listed separately, it is not a mod, but a requirements for all other mods.

* "Download" will download the latest version of the mod from its URL.
* "Install/Uninstall" will either install the mod by placing its files in the correct place inside the game folder,
or uninstall it by removing its files from the game folder.
* "Enable/Disable" will turn the mod or on off in the "mods.txt" file. For UE4SS, disabling is done by renaming the DLL files of UE4SS so that the game doesn't load them.

## Notes

The installer will attempt to repair known issues such as two UE4SS versions installed together, etc.

In case of any issues, try clicking uninstall on UE4SS and then reinstall what you need again.
